    <h2>Kurrawong AI</h2>
    <p>KurrawongAI is a small, Australian-based company enabling organisations to take control of their data.</p>
    <p>We use data modelling, data governance and data systems implementation expertise all based on <a
        href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">Semantic Web</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph">Knowledge Graph</a> principles to ensure data is in the
      richest, most open and most extensible form it can be.</p>
    <p>We use knowledge graphs for data storage, as a transfer format, when serialised, and as inputs to advanced
      reasoning and data processing tasks, such as for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine
        Learning</a> and Articial Intelligence applications.</p>
